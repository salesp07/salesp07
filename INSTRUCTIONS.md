# Usage Instructions

Video Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/eHaXw8Bd_ms

1.  Fork this repo and name it `<your-username>`
2.  In your forked repo, go to the `Settings tab > actions > general`. In the `Workflow permissions` section, toggle `Read and Write permissions` and press `save`. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
3.  Go to the `Actions` tab, select `Generate Snake` and click `run workflow`. That way, you will manually generate your first snake svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 12 hours.
4.  On line 1, rename `page_id` url param to `<your-username>.<your-username>`
5.  On line 4, rename `lines` url param to whatever you`d like
6.  Customize lines 11-21 to fit your description
7.  Customize your Socials section (23-33)
8.  Customize your Tools section (37-42)
9.  On line 50, change `/salesp07/salesp07/` to `/<your-username>/<your-username>/`. This will make sure that you're fetching your snake contributions svg and not mine.
10. In your stats section, rename `https://github-readme-salesp07.vercel.app` to `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app`. The first one is my private instance of the repo, and I use it so my private contributions are taken into account as well. Hosting your private instance of github-readme-stats on Vercel is quite a simple process and recommended; if you're interested, click [here](https://github.com/salesp07/github-readme-stats#deploy-on-your-own).
11. In the same section, replace `github-readme-streak-stats-salesp07.vercel.app` with `https://streak-stats.demolab.com`. If you want to host your own instance, which I highly recommend as it is down often, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats?tab=readme-ov-file#next-steps).
12. Customize your support link or replace it with footer typing animation (line 73).
13. You're good to go! Make sure to leave a ⭐ if you like this repo!
